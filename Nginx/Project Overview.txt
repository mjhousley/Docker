Project Overview:
Your team needs you to deploy a custom image quickly and write a quick script in a file to accomplish a task. You will do a task that you may not have done before so make sure you research if you do not know-how.

Create your own image using Nginx and adding a file that will tell you the time of day the container has been deployed

Deploy your container with port 8080 open

Save your container data to the Elastic Container Registry!
